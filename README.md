# ASKED IN BSC.CSIT MODEL QUESTION
# Create a class to show the constructor, property, indexers and encapsulation behaviour of object oriented programming language ( in C#) - BSc.CSIT Model question, .NET centric computing

This repository contains a simple C# console application that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. 
The application defines a ' Student ' class with encapsulated private fields, properties for accessing those fields, 
and an indexer for accessing an array element.

## Features

- Encapsulation of private fields using properties.
- Use of an indexer to access array elements.
- Basic demonstration of object-oriented programming principles.
